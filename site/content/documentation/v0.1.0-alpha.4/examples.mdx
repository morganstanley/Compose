### FCD3 App Directory example

This example contains a JSON file that can be used as the data source for ComposeUI's FDC3 App Directory implementation. The App Directory contains the [js-chart](https://github.com/morganstanley/ComposeUI/tree/main/examples/js-chart) and [js-grid](https://github.com/morganstanley/ComposeUI/tree/main/examples/js-datagrid) examples.

To run the example:

- Run the [serve-chart-and-grid.ps1](https://github.com/morganstanley/ComposeUI/blob/main/examples/serve-chart-and-grid.ps1) script to run the local server for the included web apps.
- Launch the Shell project using the configuration named `Chart and grid`, or use these command line arguments:

```powershell
--url http://localhost:4200 --FDC3:AppDirectory:Source $(ComposeUIRepositoryRoot)/examples/fdc3-appdirectory/apps.json
```

(you'll have to manually substitute `$(ComposeUIRepositoryRoot)` with the actual root path of the repo).
